#Day 2: Create a calculator that would result in how much each person should pay when splitting the bill amongst friends.

print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")

total_bill = input("What was the total bill? $")
percent_tip = input("What percentage tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? ")
num_people = input("How many people to split the bill? ")

split= (float(total_bill) * (1 + float(percent_tip) / 100)) / float(num_people)
split_bill = "{:.2f}".format(split)

print(f"Each person should pay: ${split_bill}")
