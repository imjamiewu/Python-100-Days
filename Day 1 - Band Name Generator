#Day 1: Create a generator that would create a band name for a user based on their city and pet inputs.

#1. Create a greeting for your program.
print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator.")

#2. Ask the user for the city that they grew up in.
city = input("What is the name of the city you grew up in?\n")

#3. Ask the user for the name of a pet.
pet = input("What is the name of your pet?\n")

#4. Combine the name of their city and pet and show them their band name.
print("Your band name could be " + city + " " + pet)

#5. Make sure the input cursor shows on a new line, see the example at:
