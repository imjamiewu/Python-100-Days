#Day 5: Create a code which would allow Reeborg to escape the maze it is in - no matter which position or direction it starts in.
#Reeborg's World can be found at the following link:

#While most cases are successful, here are a select few where Reeborg will be stuck in an infinite loop. I will be revisiting this after Day 15 once I learn more skills to debug this.
